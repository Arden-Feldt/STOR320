# STOR 320
The code I used for my part of the STOR320 final project. The Final Paper.Rmd and Final-Paper.html files here are our final paper. We got above the class average with our paper, and a 93 on our presentation (STOR 320 PROJECT.pdf). I ended the class with an A-.

## Final Paper.Rmd
This is the R notebook that generates my groups final paper. It contains several dependencies and cannot be run without shoring those up. Luckly you can see what it produces in the Final-Paper.html file.

## Final-Paper.html
This is the final submission we made. The professor overall liked it, but given more time I think there is a lot to improve. However it can be hard to coordinate 6 college students the week before finals.

## STOR 320 PROJECT.pdf
The final presentation that I and Aadi gave to our class. We recieved a 93 on it. It was made in canva as thats what my group was most familar with.

## Final Project Work Directory
Contains some cleaned up .Rmd files, that we used in the final paper. These contain work that we liked, graphes that were worth sharing, and findings that pushed us in new directions. Additionally, most of the data files they call exist, and are in the right places. So these files should run.

## Messy Work Sub Directory
Ugly barely usable files that we used while trying to find a direction. These files were made over the course of a few weeks as we met and looked at the data. The notebooks often follow the flow of conversation and lack general convention and conciseness. They also have dependencies that dont work, and were generally rendered unusable without some cleanup.

## Other work
Labs, HomeWorks, and Analysis .Rmd files are not added as this repo is public. Publishing those files is a violation of the UNC and STOR department honor codes.
